````markdown

Nexus is a **voice-enabled, context-aware personal AI assistant** inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man. It combines **neural network reasoning**, **vector memory**, and **text-to-speech** to provide intelligent responses, memory retrieval, and hands-free interaction.

---

## Features

- **Hotword Detection:** Continuously listens for activation words.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Uses Hugging Face Transformers for language understanding and generation.
- **Vector Memory:** Uses FAISS to store embeddings from text, notes, datasets, and PDFs for fast semantic search.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Reads retrieved information or responses aloud.
- **Automatic Dataset Ingestion:** Extracts and encodes text from `.zip` files or documents.
- **Memory Querying:** Retrieve past notes, research data, or user-provided datasets instantly.
- **Extensible:** Supports adding new models, datasets, and TTS configurations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nexus.git
cd nexus
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv

## Usage

1. Launch Nexus GUI:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

2. Use the interface to:

   * Add datasets or notes to vector memory.
   * Interact via hotwords or typed queries.
   * Fine-tune models or generate AI responses.
   * Listen to memory retrievals with TTS.

If you want, I can **also create a shorter, “GitHub-friendly” version** with badges, a screenshot placeholder, and a **quick-start guide** that looks super professional and will attract attention from other developers.  

Do you want me to do that next?
